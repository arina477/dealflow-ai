## Wave 7 stage completion

Seed: dfa5bd56-0c7e-46ed-830f-9c35e5bfd471 — Build sourcing-workspace page to search sources and trigger ingestion
Bundled siblings:
  - 345dfbc6-1c96-4f6a-98aa-12ac7d61794b — Implement first real DataSourceAdapter against a selected deal-source provider
Active milestone: b372bbf7-09f3-4eb0-87df-28b5ec52bfc2 — M3 — Deal sourcing & company/contact data
Pending ritual outcomes affecting P-0: M3 is `## Class product-feature` → P-0 runs mvp-thinner. UI wave (sourcing-workspace page, journey row 12) → D-block runs. Real-adapter sibling introduces an external deal-source SDK → P-3 external-sdk-integration-rules research + a SPEND-GATE (vendor selection routes to BOARD under automatic) + a SDK doc before adapter code + likely a MONITOR: task for provider tier/key activation. If the spend-gate defers the real adapter, the seed (sourcing-workspace over the existing fixture adapter) still stands alone. Backlog under M3: 3 re-parented M1 follow-ups (bfadcec1, 6fe232e3, d7f716b4) available for P-0 unassigned/queue triage, NOT part of this bundle. Unassigned queue depth at handoff: 1.
