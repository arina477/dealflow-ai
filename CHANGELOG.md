## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] — 2026-07-02

Walking skeleton: the monorepo foundation, a database-aware health endpoint, CI, and a first live deploy.

### Added
- Turborepo + pnpm monorepo with `api` (NestJS), `web` (Next.js 15), and a shared package.
- `GET /health` endpoint returning `{status, db, version}` — 200 when Postgres is reachable, 503 when it is not.
- Postgres schema managed by Drizzle with an idempotent first migration.
- GitHub Actions CI (lint, typecheck, build, integration test against real Postgres) green on `main`. (#1)
- Live deploy on Railway — API and web reachable in production.
