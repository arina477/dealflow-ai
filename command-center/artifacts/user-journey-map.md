# User Journey Map — DealFlow AI

Canonical inventory of every screen / route + the flows that connect them. Source: v3 user-flows.md + feature-list.md + founder-approved page map (v4). Regenerated at T-9 Journey each wave; consumed by T-5 (E2E swarm).

> **Internal tool:** no public marketing site for MVP. Entry is sign-in; everything else is the authed app, role-gated (Advisor / Analyst / Compliance / Admin).
>
> **Compliance-quota override:** founder-stage `pilot-customer` caps compliance surfaces at ~10% of MVP pages (excess → stub PDs). The founder's explicit compliance-first decision makes the 3 compliance screens (queue, audit log + export, rules) core to the MVP wedge, so they receive **full PDs**, not stubs. Documented in product-decisions.md.

## Page inventory (MVP / H1)

| # | Page | Route | Persona(s) | Related flows | Tools/modules |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Login | `/login` | All | auth | Auth & RBAC |
| 2 | Accept invite & set password | `/accept-invite?token=` | Invited user | F14 | Auth & RBAC |
| 3 | Reset password | `/reset-password` | All | auth | Auth & RBAC |

> **Wave 2 (auth) — LIVE (deployed + real-browser E2E 6/6):** `/login`, `/accept-invite?token=`, `/reset-password` are implemented and verified end-to-end (invite-only signup → session + role claim → role-aware landing). A placeholder authed landing `/dashboard` exists (reads the session, shows the role); the full AppShell/dashboard is a later M1 bundle. Route reconciled: journey `/invite/:token` → implemented as `/accept-invite?token=`.
| 4 | Dashboard | `/` | All (role-aware) | F1,F2,F4,F10 | most modules |
| 5 | Mandates list | `/mandates` | Adv, An | F1 | Mandate service |

## Coverage check
- Every MVP feature (#1–#19 in feature-list.md) maps to ≥1 page above. ✓
- Every page connects to ≥1 flow. ✓
- H2/H3 pages (pilot-partner workspace, CRM-integration screens, analytics, multi-tenant) are deferred — not in this MVP inventory.
